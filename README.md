# Final Fantasy-style RPG
Final Fantasy has a lot of different types of scripting elements that seem pretty interesting to implement, so this repo is going to be a selection of how I tried to make an FF style clone.

##Things to consider include:

###Overworld
- Character Movement
- Entering towns/caves/areas
- Vehicles and traversal

###Battle Systems
- Turn-based or active-time-bar?
- Enemy AI Movement in Battle
- Character Attack/Choices in Battle
- Entering Random Battles
- Entering Boss/Scripted Battle
- Enemy Stats/Moves/Encyclopedia/Bestiary

###Character/Mechanics
- Picking up items/opening treasure chests
- Large Inventory System
- Saving the game
- Character Stats and Equipment
- Magic/Jobs System/Materia/Limit Breaks
- Large Menu System
- Talking to/Interacting with NPCs
